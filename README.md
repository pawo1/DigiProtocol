# DigiProtocol
DigiProtocol is Library designed for Communication with DigiSpark over USB.
Itâ€™s based on DigiUSB library but adds protocol-frame.

## Requirements

To use DigiProtocol you will need both [libusb](https://libusb.info) for PC, and
DigiUSB for DigiSpark (available in ArduinoIDE libraries).

If you want to build tools make sure to build wxWidgets library beforehand


## Installation

Using DigiProtocol is pretty easy. On PC side it's header only library, so you
can add it to your include directory, or add path to it during compilation.

On the AVR side, you have to add library to ArduinoIDE. Choose Digiprotocol.zip
in Library Manager, or unzip it manually to the Arduino library directory.

## Examples

You can build minimal examples of Library with 'make' command (or its
equivalent on other systems e.g. 'mingw32-make')
